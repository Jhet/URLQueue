URLQueue
========

URLQueue demonstrates an iOS 8 sharing extension, written in Swift, that bundles together an app, extension, and Cocoa Touch Framework.

It allows for pushing URLs from 3rd-party apps to the URLQueue app for storage. 
These URLs can later be reopened in your browser of choice (Safari or Chrome), at which point they are removed from the queue.
You can think of it as a local read-it-later app.

Data is shared between the app and the extension using shared NSUserDefaults through App Groups.

The project was built for demonstrative purposes, and is MIT Licensed. See LICENSE for more details.
